''''
Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. 
Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).
If an element is 0, they cannot move through that element. If the end isnâ€™t reachable, return -1

def min_jump(arr, n):
    if n <= 1: 
        return 0 #return zero values if the array less than one element
    
    #assigning the value 0    
    left = 0
    right = arr[0]
    count = 1

    while right < n-1:
        count += 1 #incresing the value 
        jump = max(i + arr[i] for i in range(left, right + 1)) #by this checking all the arr and finding min values 
        left, right = right, jump #swaping the values
    return count

arr = list(map(int, input("Enter the elements: ").split()))
size = len(arr)
print('Minimum number of jumps to reach',
      'end is', min_jump(arr, size))

Time Complexity : O(N)
Space Complexity : O(1)

INPUT:
    Enter the elements: 1 3 5 8 9 2 6 7 6 8 9

OUTPUT  
    Minimum number of jumps to reach end is 3

Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 8 -> 9)

Explanation: 

The first element is 1, so can only go to 3,
The second element is 3 now there are three options 5, 8 or 9. 
If 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9 
can be reached. So 3 jumps are made.
